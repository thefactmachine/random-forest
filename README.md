random-forest
=============

Using a few different ensemble methods, including Random Forests, survival on the Titantic is predicated. 

- "caret-demonstration.R"  demonstration of the Caret package using the sonar data set.

- "demonstration-ggplot-multipleLine.R" demonstration of multiple line using GGplot2

- "mTitanic.csv" Basic Titanic data set with missing ages

- "mTitanicAge.csv" Titanic data set with missing ages being replaced by predicted ages.

- "titanic-ada-caret.R" Uses the Caret package and Ada Boost to create 486 models and then choose the best model

- "titanic-forest-age.R" Uses Random Forests to predict missing ages (randomForest package)

- "titanic-forest-party-survived.R" Uses Random Forests to predict survival (party package)

- "titanic-forest-surived-matrix.R" Incomplete.  Graphing of Random Forest Monte Carlo simulation

- "titanic-forest-survived.R" Uses Random Forests to predict survival (randomForest package)

- "titanic-gbm-survived.R" Uses generalised boosing models to predict survival (gbm package)

- "titanic-rforest-caret.R" Uses the Caret package to generate 9 models and then choose the best (randomForest)
